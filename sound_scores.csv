1,5,5,Sad but sweet. nostalgia – longing. started pleasant abrupt end. Feels like a song about separation and the journey to find something ,
2,6,6,Intenseinsistent? Hopeful nostalgia remembering.,Starts low but active  quick notes that climb higher quickly too. Fair amount of chords. More song-like/melodious than many prev tracks. Higher notes are loud and insistent  start to ping after 1 min mark. Very insistent like it wants your attention  leading up to the pinging. Gets a sadder/more longing-ish after the midrange notes for 2 min mark  ends on an upwards notes
3,3.5,3.5,Muted joy? At beginning   more melancholic as it goes along. Like it’s looking for something? Esp with the sonar,Low energy at start  then picks up a bit  low notes and then starts to climb. Repeated high notes  painful to listen to – almost like sonar. Makes you wonder what it’s picking up on. Grows in intensity throughout piece. Lack of mid-range notes for most of the piece – two extremes. The lowest notes are almost inaudible even at my computer’s highest volume
4,7.5,7.5,Grief sadness,Fast high notes that quickly fall. Slowly level out but lower notes  slow down too. Briefly go high  but still a bit of sadness to them. Almost entirely quiets out around 1:20  like something is missing. Much more lower notes  few highs  kind of pensive sadness and less acute grief as it moves further? Sadness there throughout  earlier grief-y sound is repeated around 2:45/2:50ish with the downward progression  some mid-to-higher notes at the end  lead to pleasant chords with lower notes to sound a bit serene  ends on higher notes so like hopeful sadness?
5,5.5,5.5,Nostalgic but also hopeful near midpoint,Much faster pace  shorter notes that blend better. Low-to-middle range notes  not a ton of high notes. Around 1 minute mark the higher notes makes it seem much more emotional of a piece. Similar sonar-like high notes at later point. More complex sounds than the previous (fig3). End of song winds down and is almost inaudible with the low notes. Feels more complete? Like it has an appropriate ending
6,9,9,Alert but nostalgic storytime feel?,Pinging like radar  very fast. Comes and goes so kind of like a fight? Sounds kind of like something striking metal repeatedly but not in a pattern  maybe mining related? Overpowers whole track. Melody stays pretty lower-midtone the whole time.
7,6.5,6.5,Bit more sad at parts than the othersmore melancholic and depressed? Slower melody. Tragic? Faster bits are intense and alert but not joyous,Continues with the radar for a bit  maybe 7 continues with the same content as 6 for a bit. The pings are a bit lower though  and move around more. Even with the higher pins it sounds kind of tragic  even the higher parts aren’t a happy kind of higher notes
8,6.5,6.5,Adventurous? Happier than previous,Quick notes but low so feeling of not super intense  all over the map  more chords. Gains in joy as you go further along. Feels like abrupt ending
9,8,8,Intense stressed? Melancholic at parts,Starts like how fig 8 ends but then goes more melancholic and is slower with deeper notes  midway is dischordant with similar notes that are unpleasant together – very striking though. ¾ through turns more to melody  loses the painful high notes for a bit before they return. Melody remains steady and low-sih  with high punctuations at the end. Ending is very abrupt
10,7.5,7.5,Determined? Closer to happy but still a bit short? Striking,Nostalgic and highnote heavy – carrying more of the melody than previous songs. Still not happy but closer? Uncomfortable but kind of pleased? Determined?  More individual notes/fewer chords
11,7.5,7.5,Joyful and nostalgic,Starts like 10 ends  I assume they are connected  but then it quickly goes lower and slower. Then picks up again and sounds close to joyful  but also nostalgic
12,8,8,Nostalgic but hopeful then more melancholic then almost hopeless. Fragile hope at end?,"Light and twinkling, but with slow lower notes   starts out kind of nostalgic but happy before it starts to slow down   gets sadder and more melancholic. Around 1 min mark, gets very low with no right hand, climbs back up to mid-to-high-hand   pinging returns here and there. Goes higher, but then lower again and gets kind of hopeless around 2:50? Starts to climb at the end but not with joy, kind of fragile hope"
13,6.5,6.5,Serene melancholic depressed. ,"Starts with mid-range-to-high, pining radar returns   kind of hollow. Melody is kind of serene/melancholic? Very different with melody vs pinging   then are merged together in mid-to-lower range. Very melodic, almost like a song for a bit. Higher notes start to return, and then disappear for a while. Feels sad but not tragic, not acute enough for grief. Ends abruptly in what feels like the middle of a melody"
14,6.5,6.5,Kind of serene? ,Plays the two extremes for a while  with the higher notes striking hardest and the lower notes presenting a melody but hard to hear  a return to the earlier sonar but at a lower register (upstair neighbour’s dog was unhappy)  drops off the higher notes for the last 30 seconds and it feels very serene/at peace almost?
15,5,5,Hopeful? Serene relaxed – less intense. Still a bit nostalgic,Starts with higher melody  quick notes but not as striking/more mellow high notes. Much less depressing than earlier pieces  though still not happy/excited.
16,7,7,Sad nostalgia melancholic depressed,Fast notes but mid-range  then goes a bit higher before leading back down for quite a while. Lots of mid-to-low range notes  makes it seem sad but active. Occasionally leads up but then always comes down. Mostly a sad tone  kind of melancholic and depressed because the little bits of hope never stay. Go back down near end  very melodious but sad. Kind of tragic but not immediately after a tragedy? Like the song in a movie showing grieving at a funeral where they’re trying to be happy and it’s raining to show their collective emotion [this one was very emotional/depressing – I think it was the first one where I actually felt sad after it]
17,6,6,Serene pensive sad but accepting. Kind of sweet? melancholic,Starts extremely low but intensely  almost inaudible for 15 seconds. Climbs up after  but then goes back down and slows down. Kind of sweet tones?  Serene/pensive/accepting of the sadness? Pinging returns at a lower town for a bit  then a bit of pleasant melody with a bit of sadness/melancholy. Ends very abruptly.
18,8,8,grasping hope sweet melancholic sad,"Pinging starts right at the beginning and then turns to high notes moving   hopeful? High notes disappear around 1:15ish, goes almost inaudible with low notes, with occasional higher or high moments but reverts back to low   kind of like a grasping hope? Melody returns in midrange around 2:45, sweet hope but still melancholic/sad. Ends on those hollow high notes, very abruptly. "
19,7,7,Frantic desperate sad hollow,Starts very abruptly with mid-to-high  no lead in. kind of a double pinging for a bit  but still sad but the higher pinging still continues. Kind of like a hollow plucking – the notes are very short. Searching? Around 1 min mark both L and R hands are pinging – very little melody  more just plucking the keys almost – very abrupt notes. Lower in tone and quietness  around 2 min mark only one note being played repeatedly until melody comes in around 2:10. Goes higher and more frantic  melody comes in and slows down but still a bit frantic  desperate. Goes lower at end  with a bit of a low-almost-inaudible melody.
20,8.5,8.5,Anticipation nervousness? Alert flighty,Quick  light notes  kind of like rain pattering with high chords  almost no low notes – anticipating  kind of nervous-seeming. Goes to one note plinking for a while  all mid-to-high. Too hollow for joy  kind of searching? Similar tempo throughout  ends on a high note suddenly
21,7,7,Fragile melancholic sad,Starts even higher than the last one ends  but continues with the lack of low notes. Very hollow  fragile. Goes more mid-range-to-lower but with some plinking still. Still searching but a bit more sad  not finding what they wanted. The plinking also slows down  kind of like the radar isn’t getting results. Goes lower around 2:30  more of a melody – no more plinking. Some high notes  but more melodious  low notes start to go so low they are almost inaudible even at high volume. Taper off slowly in that descent. 
22,6,6,Sad empty. Melancholic. Pensive. ,Start the lowest I have heard so far  higher notes start around 20 sec mark. From 30 sec to it goes so low I thought it stopped. At 1 minute higher again before lower. Feels like it’s representing hollow spaces where things used to be  and where only some remain. Many hollow spaces with nothing or little parts (deep but audible notes) remain. Higher notes where things still are. 
23,7,7,Nervous alert melancholic but steady anticipation too,Starts higher  the lows are higher too. Repetitive notes but not the same painful sonar as the first few. Lower notes are gone  higher notes only for a while. Kind of searching pattern (lower-higher-higher-lower-lower-higher-higher-lower-lower-lower  etc.)  2 min mark radar but at mid-to-high range like earlier in track
